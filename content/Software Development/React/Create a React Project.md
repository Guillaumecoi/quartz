This is the way I do it, you can find other ways and more documentation on the [official website](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/getting-started).
## Prerequisites
- `Node.js `and `npm` installed on your system.

## Create the project
---

Create a new project directory and run the following command (replace `my-app` with a name of choice):

```shell
npx create-react-app my-app
```

This will do the following:
- Create a new directory with your app name.
- Download and install all the required packages for a React project.
- Set up a basic folder structure with the necessary files.

**Notes:** 
- Installation might take a few minutes.
- You can create projects with templates:
  ```shell
  npx create-react-app my-app --template [template-name]
```
	- The `--template typescript` option is a popular one that provides TypeScript support.

## Start the Project
---
Once the installation is complete open your app folder and run:
```shell
npm start
```

This will open your project in a web browser, usually at http://localhost:3000
