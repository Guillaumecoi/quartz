- Defines a clear **contract** or **blueprint** that classes agree to follow, ensuring consistency and predictability in their design.
- It mandates the implementation of specific methods but does not provide any implementation details itself, focusing solely on what must be done, not how it should be done.

#### Examples:
---
- **Sensor Interface:**
    - An interface `Sensor` might declare methods like `readValue()` or `reset()`, and different sensor types (like `TemperatureSensor`, `PressureSensor`) would implement these methods.
